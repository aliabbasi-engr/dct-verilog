## DCT - Verilog
Note: This is a Verilog implementation for the DCT algorithm as taught by Shrenik Jain on YouTube ([Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW3Hc0Wrgl0&t=405s)). Although this code is synthesizable, I recommend you to use it only for simulation purposes because it uses the matrix multiplication method (not efficient).
Please uncomment "i_clk" and "i_rst" if you want to replace the multiplier with an IP core.
